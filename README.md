# Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

# Recipeasy

For this project I have decided to bring to life a simple idea and a thought that comes into my head every time I look in my scarce food cupboards - 
what can I make with what I have left?

The premise is simple - enter the ingredients you have left into the search bar, and the site will return to you a list of recipes that you can make with what you have.
Even if you don't have everything, it's a step in the right direction.
