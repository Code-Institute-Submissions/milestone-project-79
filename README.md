# Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

# Recipeasy

For this project I have decided to bring to life a simple idea and a thought that comes into my head every time I look in my scarce food cupboards - 
what can I make with what I have left?

The premise is simple - enter the ingredients you have left into the search bar, and the site will return to you a list of recipes that you can make with what you have.
Even if you don't have everything, it's a step in the right direction.

I will utilise JavaScript and jQuery to provide the interactiivity of the site and to communicate with a recipe database API which should return all of the information
required for any potential users.

## UX

The demographic of the website is potentilly quite a broad specturm of people, as everybody will at some point need to cook a meal and may face the tough decision of what they
actually want to cook. For this reason, the site will need to be as straighforward as possible to use, with clear directions and interactivity on how to use it. If a user is potentially
not as tech savvy, then an "About" section will be included in order to explain the premise of the site, as well as a "Contact" section where any potential users may wish to provide feedback
on the functionality of the site.

Because of this, I have identified one main user of the site:

### User Stories

#### Casual User

As a casual user, I would like to be able to navigate each page easily, so that I can enjoy the content without worrying about getting lost.
